   From this map we can clearly see that the number of male earning above 3000 dollars per week is larger the number of female in Sydney.</P>
   <h5>What does the data mean?</h5>
   <p>By putting the dataset to the excel document, I found that, in 2016,  the number of female in NSW was about 0.2million more than the number of female, however, the percentage of male earning above 3000 dollars per week was about 5.2 percent while female occupies only 1.7 percent. In addition the number of male earning above 3000 dollars was about 0.1million more than female.</p>
   <h5>Why does the gap exist?</h5>
   <p>One of the main reasons behand this pay gap could be gender inequality. According to Australian Human Rights Commission, women have to work an extra 56 days a year to earn the same pay as men for doing the same work, in addition, females in Australia are over-represented in low-paid companies and insecure work instead of presented in leadership roles. </p>

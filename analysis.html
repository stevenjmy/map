   From this map we can clearly see that the number of male earning above 3000 dollars per week is larger than the number of females in Sydney. The highest column represents the largest number of people has 3000 dollars above per week in one region is 158 in the given area. We can also see that people around CBD makes more income than other region for both male and female, however, much more males makes higher income than females in Kellyville.</P>
   <h5>What does the data mean?</h5>
   <p>By putting the dataset to the excel document, I found that, in 2016,  the number of female in NSW was about 0.2million more than the number of female, however, the percentage of male earning above 3000 dollars per week was about 5.2 percent while female occupies only 1.7 percent. In addition the number of male earning above 3000 dollars was about 0.1million more than female.</p>
   <h5>Why does the gap exist?</h5>
   <p>One of the main reasons behand this pay gap could be gender inequality. According to Australian Human Rights Commission, women have to work an extra 56 days a year to earn the same pay as men for doing the same work, in addition, females in Australia are over-represented in low-paid companies and insecure work instead of presented in leadership roles. </p>

     <p>The highest column represents the largest number of people has no income in the region is 860. We can see that there are lots of people have no income around Olympic park, Sydney CBD and Randwick, especially for female.</p>
     <h5>What does the data mean?</h5>
     <p>From the dataset, I found that, in 2016, the percentage of male without income occupied around 8 percent, while the number for female without income was about 11 percent.</p>
     <h5>Why does the gap exist?</h5>
     <p>One of the reasons could be education and employment inequality. In 2016, about 26 percent women aged 20-24 years was not fully engaged in either education or employment, and the number of men was 22 percent, mentioned by Australian Bereau of Statistics. </p>

     <h1>Latte Line</h1>
     
     <h4>"The ‘latte line’ is an imaginary boundary that splits Sydney down class and economic lines, running from the airport north-west through Parramatta.”- Nigel GladstoneThe</h4> 
     <p>The map shows that people makes more money around CBD and north Sydney. The latte line clearly divided the region where people has more income and the region where people has less income. This is reasonable, as considered that a large amount of population are living in these regions, and bigger city or busier district creates more opportunities.</p>
     <P><img src="lattie.JPG" width="1000" height="600" alt="image missing!" ></P>
     
     <h1>Conclusion</h1>
     <p>Overall, the number of males makes higher income is more than the number of females around Sydney. The reason causes less rich female people than rich male people could include different level of education and gender inequality, however, it is also possible that some females does not need to work, which also attribute to less number of rich female.  </p>
     <p>The region also affect the number of richest and poorest people. The place, like CBD,   has larger amount population also has more rich people.   Interestingly, in the CBD, there are still lots of people who has no income. This shows the existence of gap between poor and rich people in the city. </p>

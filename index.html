    <h1>Term Definition</h1>
    <p>"SA1 refers to Statistical Areas Level 1 which are geographical areas built from whole Mesh Blocks. All the data in SA1s aggregate to form SA2(Statistical Areas Level 2). The SA1s have generally been designed as the smallest unit for the release of census data. Moreover, SA1s have a population of between 200 and 800 people with an average population size of approximately 400 people." The census was taking in 2016.</p>
    <p>"Data journalism is the use of data and number crunching in journalism to uncover, better explain and/or provide context to a news story. According to the Data Journalism Handbook, data can be either the tool used to tell a story, the source upon which a story is based, or both. It often involves the use of statistics, charts, graphs or infographics." One of the example can be found here:http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/MYANMAR-ROHINGYA/010051VB46G/index.html </p>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The income between male and female is not equal in Australia and the earnings’ gap is known as pay gap, mentioned by Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA). Currently, Australia’s national pay gap is 14.6%, the lowest level in 20years. The data I am assigned to analyze is the 2016 census data on Total Personal Income (Weekly) by Age by Sex in NSW and mainly focused on Sydney. </p>
    <br>
    <h1>Who will use the dataset?</h1>
    <p>The dataset is collected to allow WGEA to check the pay gap difference, also find the potential reasons behind by combining with other dataset, such as job types etc. It also allows the government to check the distribution of how and where people makes most of earnings or no income. This will assist the government to plan and arrange employment and health care and will probably affect the city development and construction strategy. Moreover, if the dataset focusses on the national level, the government may also use this data to change the way of population mobility. This dataset can also be used by marketing sectors from variable industries to arrange products and services to certain people and set suitable prices for certain group.  Investors, someone interested in real estate, may have better judgement about which area should be considered as a potential investment region, while real estate agencies can make a reasonable selling price in a certain area by analyzing the dataset.</p>
    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p>The data I selected to analyze is the relationship between the total number of females with highest earnings and the total number of males with highest earnings in NSW. I would like to find the difference level between the number of males and females with income above 3000 dollars, and also try to find the potential reason behind this. </p>
    <p>In addition, The total number of females has no income and the total number of males has no income will also be analyzed, in order to see the gap between the number of male and female without income, and also finding the reason behind this.</p>
    <p>Finally, the total number of people who has income greater than 3000 dollars per week will also be analyzed to determine which region has more people who makes the largest amount of money among all participants per week in Sydney, and to find the relationship between between the 'latte line' and the regions.</p>

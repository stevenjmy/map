   <h2>The Story</h2>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h4>The income between male and female is not equal in Australia and the earnings’ gap is known as pay gap, mentioned by Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA). Currently, Australia’s national pay gap is 14.6%, the lowest level in 20years. The data I am assigned to analyze is the 2016 census data on Total Personal Income (Weekly) by Age by Sex in NSW and mainly focused on Sydney. </h4>
    <br>
    <h1>Who will use the dataset?</h1>
    <h4>The dataset is collected to allow WGEA to check the gap difference, also find the potential reason behind by combining with other dataset, such as job types etc. it also allows the government to check the distribution of how and where people makes most of earnings or no income. This will assist the government to plan and arrange employment and health care and will probably affect the city development and construction strategy. Moreover, if the dataset focusses on the national level, the government may also use this data to change the way of population mobility. This dataset can also be used by marketing sectors from variable industries to arrange products and services to certain people and set suitable prices for certain group.  Investors, someone interested in real estate, may have better judgement about which area should be considered as a potential investment region, while real estate agencies can make a reasonable selling price in a certain area by analyzing the dataset.</h4>
